## DPDK API

### Meter

```cpp
// Initialize the runtime data of srtcm for each stream
int rte_meter_srtcm_config(struct rte_meter_srtcm *m, struct rte_meter_srtcm_params *params);

// To dye each incoming packet, the incoming srtcm is the runtime data corresponding to each stream.
static inline enum rte_meter_color rte_meter_srtcm_color_blind_check(struct rte_meter_srtcm *m,
	uint64_t time, uint32_t pkt_len)
```

### Dropper

```cpp
// Initialize the color configuration for each stream
int rte_red_config_init(struct rte_red_config *red_cfg, const uint16_t wq_log2, const uint16_t min_th, const uint16_t max_th, const uint16_t maxp_inv);

// Initialize the runtime data of the dropper
int rte_red_rt_data_init(struct rte_red *red)
    
// determine whether it needs to be discarded.
static inline int rte_red_enqueue(const struct rte_red_config *red_cfg,
    struct rte_red *red, const unsigned q, const uint64_t time)
```

## Parameter Deduction

### Meter

1. By calling `rte_get_tsc_hz ()`, you can know that the HZ of the virtual machine CPU. The frequency here is used for the conversion of the following time units.
2. Meter converts cir to cir_period and cir bytes per period. Cir_period refers to how many cycles to fill the token bucket, and CIR bytes per period refers to how many bytes to fill per period.
3. By calculating the packet sending rate in main, it is obtained that every 1,000,000 ns, on average, each stream will send Packets * 640 Bytes = 160,000, that is, each stream will send 160,000,000 Bytes per second, which is FLOW 0 CIR Value.
4. For FLOW 0, to get the maximum bandwidth, the maximum possible packet sending rate is (128 + 1024) * 1500 * 1000 = 1,728,000,000 Byte, cbs and ebs should be set as large as possible, so that their packets are infected Into green.
5. For FLOW 1, the cir should be half of FLOW 0. Adjust cbs and ebs so that the number of green packets dyed in FLOW 1 is approximately equal to half of the number of green packets in FLOW 0. The number of yellow packets and green packets Almost, the remaining packets are red packets.
6. In the same way, the settings of other streams are similar.

### Dropper

1. For Flow0, Since FLOW 0 can get the maximum bandwidth, the min_th and max_th of the green packets should be adjusted as large as possible, respectively 1022 and 1023, and the packet loss rate should be as low as possible, so set maxp_inv to 255 , Only one out of 255 packets will be lost. In this case, FLOW 0's green packets are basically not lost, and the previous meter basically dyed FLOW 0's packets to green, so FLOW 0 has the maximum bandwidth.
2. For Flow 1-3, Since the green packet ratio set in Meter above is almost equal to the bandwidth ratio, for other streams, the green packet should be dropped as little as possible, but it must be discarded. Therefore, the min_th of the green packet is set to about 64, and the max_th of the green packet is set to 1023. In this case, most of the green packets will not be discarded. Increase the yellow and red packet loss rates of Flow 1-3 by setting the min_th and max_th of the red packets and yellow packets to be relatively small. At the same time, maxp_inv is also set to be relatively small. In this case, most of the yellow packets and red packets are discarded, but it is also guaranteed that the yellow packets and red packets will not be lost. Has a low packet loss rate.
4. Finally, the remaining work is fine-tuning, so that the bandwidth ratio of the four streams is 8: 4: 2: 1

## Result

On average, a total of 1,600,000 Bytes are sent per stream, so FLOW 0 sends all without packet loss, while FLOW 1 can send about 800,000 Bytes, FLOW 2 can send about 400,000 Bytes, and FLOW 3 can send about 200,000 Bytes. (8:4:2:1)

## Feelings

I am really grateful for the help of dynamicheart-2015 about the parameter dedution process. I didn't work out by myself at first. Then I learnt about the methods of this senior and finished implementing my lab.
